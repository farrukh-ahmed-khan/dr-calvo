Microneedling involves creating tiny punctures in the skin, which can stimulate the skin's natural healing process, potentially leading to the production of capillaries, elastin, and collagen. Concurrently, the application of radio frequency energy aims to further encourage the skin's rejuvenation process by heating the underlying layers, which may contribute to skin tightening and enhanced production of collagen and elastin. Additionally, we incorporate exosomes as a supplementary product to potentially support the skin's healing from RF microneedling and to foster the collagen-enhancing effects.",
